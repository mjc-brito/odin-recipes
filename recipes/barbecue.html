    <h2>Grill, smoke and savor the flavor - barbecue, the ultimate outdoor cooking experience</h2>
    <p>Barbecue, often shortened to BBQ, is a method of cooking meat, fish, or vegetables over an open flame or hot coals. This cooking technique originated in the Caribbean and has since spread throughout the world, with variations in style and flavor depending on the region. Barbecue is often associated with outdoor social gatherings, such as backyard parties and picnics, and is a popular cuisine for casual dining. The cooking process typically involves slow-cooking the meat or vegetables over low heat, which results in tender and flavorful dishes. Barbecue is often accompanied by a variety of sauces and sides, such as coleslaw, baked beans, and cornbread.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 pounds of beef sirloin or ribeye, sliced into 1/2-inch thick pieces</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat;</li>
        <li>Season the beef slices generously with coarse sea salt on both sides;</li>
        <li>Place the beef slices on the grill and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until desired doneness;</li>
